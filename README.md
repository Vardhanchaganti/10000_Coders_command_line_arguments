## 10000_Coders_command_line_arguments
Thanks for visiting this github repository.
In this repository you will find 4 different programs which perform same kind of operations like taking run time input and then printing it.
3 of these programs namely personal, education, family are very similar wherease the 4th one qualification is a bit different.
In the qualification program i wanted to make sure confidentiality for those who don't want to share their G.P.A - thatâ€™s perfectly okay too. Your worth isn't defined by numbers.
And for those who wish to go ahead and own it!

You can use the class files to run the programs and the java files to go through the code
I appreciate going through the the output_imgs
